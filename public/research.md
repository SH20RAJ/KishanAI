# how many types of kishan in india and  with percentage and all research and servey data about kishan

Perfect! Now let me compile all this information into a comprehensive report.

## Types and Distribution of Farmers (Kishan) in India

India has a highly fragmented agricultural sector with **five official categories of farmers** classified based on the size of land holdings. According to the latest **Agriculture Census 2015-16**, there are approximately **146.45 million operational holdings** across the country, making India's farmer classification system one of the most important agricultural parameters for policy and development initiatives.

### The Five Categories of Farmers

**Marginal Farmers** constitute the largest group, representing **65.45% of all farmers** with holdings **below 1.00 hectare**. These 95.70 million farmers operate an average of **0.38 hectares** per holding. Despite being nearly two-thirds of India's farming population, marginal farmers control only **24.03% of the total operated area** (37.75 million hectares), indicating severe land inequality.[^1][^2][^3]

**Small Farmers** represent **20.75% of all holdings** (30.29 million farmers) with landholdings between **1.00-2.00 hectares**. They operate an average of **1.41 hectares** and collectively control **22.91% of the operated land area** (36.0 million hectares). Combined with marginal farmers, small and marginal farmers (SMF) together account for **86.08% of all operational holdings** but hold only **46.94% of the total land area**.[^3][^4][^1]

**Semi-Medium Farmers** hold between **2.00-4.00 hectares**, representing **9.02% of holdings** (13.18 million farmers). They operate an average of **2.70 hectares** and control **19.47% of the operated area** (30.6 million hectares).[^4][^3]

**Medium Farmers** own holdings between **4.00-10.00 hectares**, constituting **3.80% of all farmers** (5.56 million farmers). They operate an average of **5.72 hectares** and collectively hold **20.52% of the operated area** (32.24 million hectares).[^3][^4]

**Large Farmers** represent the smallest segment with only **0.57% of holdings** (approximately 833,000 farmers) possessing lands **10.00 hectares and above**. Despite being less than 1% of the farmer population, they operate an average of **17.10 hectares** per holding and control **9.07% of the total operated area** (14.25 million hectares).[^4][^3]

### Additional Farmer Classifications

Beyond the five main size-based categories, India's farming population includes other important classifications:

**Tenant Farmers and Sharecroppers** represent approximately **14% of the farming community** (around 1.2 crore farmers). These are individuals who cultivate land owned by others. Research shows that **36% of tenant farmers are completely landless**, while **56% own less than one hectare**. Over **20% of India's landholdings** are farmed by tenant farmers who often lack access to formal credit, government support services, and agricultural schemes designed for landholders.[^5][^6]

**Landless Agricultural Laborers** constitute a significant portion of rural India's working population. According to Census 2011, there are approximately **494.9 million landless individuals** in villages directly or indirectly dependent on cultivation for livelihoods. Compared to Census 2001, the proportion of agricultural laborers has increased from **26.5% to over 33%** of the rural population, reflecting a worrying trend of farmer distress and land alienation.[^6][^7]

### Key Statistics and Survey Data

The **Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) 2018-19** reveals that approximately **89.4% of agricultural households** own less than two hectares of land, reinforcing the concentration of small and marginal holdings. The **NABARD All-India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS) 2021-22**, based on data from over 100,000 rural households across 29 states and union territories, provides critical insights into farmer welfare and financial inclusion.[^8][^9][^10]

### Distribution Across Indian States

The concentration of small and marginal farmers varies significantly across India. **50% of India's SMF population lives in five states**: Uttar Pradesh (18%), Bihar (13%), Maharashtra (10%), Madhya Pradesh (6%), and Andhra Pradesh (6%). States like Kerala, Bihar, West Bengal, Jammu \& Kashmir, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu have **over 90% of their landholdings classified as small and marginal**, while states such as Punjab, Haryana, and Arunachal Pradesh have relatively larger landholdings.[^11]

### Land Fragmentation Trends

A critical concern is the **continuous decline in average landholding size**. The average farm holding has shrunk from **2.3 hectares in 1970-71 to 1.08 hectares in 2015-16**—representing a 53% decrease over 45 years. Meanwhile, the number of operational holdings has nearly doubled from 71 million (1970-71) to 146 million (2015-16). This fragmentation is driven by population growth, inheritance laws, and the practice of land subdivision among family members.[^12][^11][^13]

### Income and Livelihoods

Despite producing over **60% of India's total food grain production**, small and marginal farmers face severe income challenges. According to NABARD's NAFIS 2021-22 survey, **55.4% of agricultural households are indebted**, with average debt standing at ₹91,231. The income structure for marginal farmers is heavily dependent on non-farm income sources, with **wage labor contributing 52% of their total income**.[^2][^14]

The Situation Assessment Survey 2018-19 shows that marginal and small farmer incomes are increasingly diversified, with contributions from wage labor (52%), livestock (20%), and other non-farm activities supplementing crop income. This reflects the inadequacy of crop income alone for family sustenance.[^15]

### Social Group Distribution

The farmer population is also stratified by social groups. According to Agriculture Census 2015-16:

- **Scheduled Castes (SC)** farmers: Around 22% are marginal/semi-marginal farmers compared to 7.8% of medium and large farmers
- **Scheduled Tribes (ST)** farmers: Approximately 15.6% of small farmers belong to STs compared to 14.9% among medium farmers
- The concentration of disadvantaged social groups among marginal and small farmers indicates overlapping socio-economic vulnerabilities[^13]


### Recent Developments and Challenges

The **Situation Assessment Survey 2018-19** and **NABARD's NAFIS 2021-22** indicate that while rural household incomes have shown nominal growth, income disparities persist across farm sizes. Agricultural households' average monthly income increased from ₹6,426 in 2012-13 to ₹10,218 in 2018-19, but this represents income from all sources including wages and livestock, not primarily from crop cultivation.[^2][^9][^15]

The **Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme** has shown significant expansion, with coverage increasing from 10.5% of agricultural households in 2016-17 to 44.1% in 2021-22, indicating improved financial inclusion for small and marginal farmers.[^9]

### Summary of Farmer Types Distribution

| Farmer Category | Land Size | Number (millions) | % of Farmers | Area Held (mha) | % of Area | Avg Size (ha) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Marginal** | < 1 ha | 95.70 | 65.45% | 37.75 | 24.03% | 0.38 |
| **Small** | 1-2 ha | 30.29 | 20.75% | 36.0 | 22.91% | 1.41 |
| **Semi-Medium** | 2-4 ha | 13.18 | 9.02% | 30.6 | 19.47% | 2.70 |
| **Medium** | 4-10 ha | 5.56 | 3.80% | 32.24 | 20.52% | 5.72 |
| **Large** | ≥ 10 ha | 0.83 | 0.57% | 14.25 | 9.07% | 17.10 |
| **TOTAL** | — | **146.45** | **100%** | **157.14** | **100%** | **1.08** |

The fundamental challenge facing Indian agriculture is the extreme fragmentation and the concentration of the farming population into economically non-viable small holdings. With 86% of farmers operating less than 2 hectares, most are unable to generate sufficient income from crop cultivation alone, necessitating supplementary income from wages, livestock, and other non-agricultural activities.
